About OpenFDEM
----------------

**OpenFDEM** aims to be a free and object-oriented finite and discrete element solver for solving multiscale, multiphase and multiphysics (3M) problems 
that can be operated on various platforms, such as Linux, Unix and Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP) systems. The applications are, but not limited to, mechanical, 
thermal and fluid problems. The program is also optimized from design to algorithm to boost the computation speed. This project started from 2018 when 
I was a PhD candidate in Monash University, and the very basic version was finished in 2020 when I graduated from Institute of Rock 
and Soil Mechanics, China Academy of Science. After that, I turned to a full-time developer and co-PI of this project in University of Toronto since September 
in 2021, under the supervision of Professor Giovanni Grasselli. More details about OpenFDEM were presented in the Global FDEM workshop "FDEM-2022-Modeling 
innovations and numerical experiments in geomechanics" which held in Toronto on December 9, 2022. The recording of this workshop can be found 
at https://geogroup.utoronto.ca/global-fdem-2022/.
