Create Uniaxial Compression Test with Quadrangle Element
########################################################################

By default, triangle elements will be used in the mesh and model. However, OpenFDEM also supports 
the quadrangle elements. To run the model with quadrangle elements, users just need to add the 
following line after setting up the mesh size and before creating the mesh.


.. code-block:: openfdem
    :linenos:

    of.geometry.recombine 'rock' 

When the program runs, the mesh of the model will look like this.

The program also shows the mesh has quadrilateral elements.
