Create a model from imported mesh
#######################################

OpenFDEM also allows users to import common mesh files such as ``.inp`` files, ``.msh`` files, and ``.geo`` files to run the model. 
This example will review how to setup a uniaxial compressive test example with output from ``Gmsh`` software. 

**Runtime**: <10 min on i9 8-core Windows 10 Machine

.. note::
   OpenFDEM supports four main mesh pre-processing approaches:

   1. A user defined command in OpenFDEM to create mesh automatically
   2. Importing a ``.geo`` file
   3. Importing a ``.msh`` file 
   4. Mesh developed from other commercial softwares, including ``.inp``, ``.dxf``, ``.fdem``, ``.tess`` (for grain-based model only) and ``.jpg`` (for grain-based module and DFN module only).

1 Tutorial Prerequistes
==================================
The following files are needed to follow along the tutorial:

- `Job-3.inp`_ (click to download from GitHub)

.. _Job-3.inp: https://github.com/OpenFDEM-geomechanics/Examples/blob/main/CreateUniaxialCompressionTestfromInputMesh/Job-3.inp


==================================
2 Codes
==================================

1. OpenFDEM supports various common mesh file format such as .inp files, .msh files, and .geo files. In this example, 
“Job-3.inp” file in the folder will be imported to the model, which has the same mesh as the first unconfined compression 
test example.

2. Given input file was exported from ABAQUS without assigning groups, so users need to group elements manually here.
