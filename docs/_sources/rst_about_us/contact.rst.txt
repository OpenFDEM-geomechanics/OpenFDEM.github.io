Bio: 
 Giovanni Grasselli is a Professor and the NSERC/Energi Simulation Industrial Research Chair in 
 Fundamental Petroleum Rock Physics and Rock Mechanics at the University of Toronto. His research
 focuses on hybrid finite-discrete element (FDEM) numerical technology, experimental visualization 
 techniques, and geomechanics principles applied to the study of tunneling and hydraulic fracturing. 
 He received the prestigious ISRM Rocha Medal (2004) for best thesis worldwide in rock mechanics and 
 supervised two Rocha Medal winners (2015 and 2017). Through the start-up company Geomechanica Inc.,
 the FDEM technology is currently commercialized and translated to engineering practice.

Bio: 
 Dr. Xiaofeng Li earned his PhD degree from the Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, 
 Chinese Academy of Sciences and Monash University in 2019. He is a postdoc in Grasselli's 
 Geomechanics Group at University of Toronto since 2021. His research interests lie in the 
 fields of rock dynamics and computational mechanic sciences with emphasis on the development 
 of the hybrid continuum and discontinuum methods for failure modelling of geomaterials spanning
 the scale from micro-grain-based heterogeneity (mineral, texture, anisotropy, grain morphology) 
 to macro- in-situ applications (rock faulting, geothermal-induced earthquakes). He is the recipient 
 of the 2021 ROCHA runner-up of the ISRM. He is awarded as future leader of Class 2022 in ARMA. 
 He is the lead developer of the opensource continuum-discontinuum code (OpenFDEM), which aims to be
 a free finite and discrete element kernel with object-oriented architecture for solving multiscale, 
 multiphase and multiphysics (3M) problems that operates on various platforms.
