OpenFDEM is free software: that means you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (in your option) any later version. OpenFDEM is not in the public domain; it is copyrighted, and there are restrictions on its distribution. However, these restrictions are designed to permit everything that a good cooperating citizen would like to do. The purpose of licensing is trying to prevent others from further sharing any version of OpenFDEM that they might get from you.
Specifically, we want to make sure that you should give away copies of OpenFDEM, that you receive source code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change OpenFDEM or use pieces of OpenFDEM in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to deprive anyone else of these rights. For example, if you distribute copies of OpenFDEM, you must give the recipients all the rights and the responsibilities that you have. You must make sure that they also receive or can also get the source code. And you must tell them their rights and responsibilities.
OpenFDEM is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.
You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with OpenFDEM. If not, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

If you want to integrate parts of OpenFDEM into a closed-source or commercial software or want to sell a modified closed-source version of OpenFDEM, please contact Dr. Xiaofeng Li directly by email for a different license and more information.
