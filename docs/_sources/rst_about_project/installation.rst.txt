Installation
==================================

Mandatory Packages
---------------------
To compile ``OpenFDEM``, you neeed a complier supporting ``C++ 17`` and the following packages are required:

- **CMake** (>= version 3.15) - cross-platform build system
- C, C++ compiler with Standard Template Library (STL) support, C++ 20 is mandatory.
- **OpenMP** - a high-performance, freely available package for multi core acceleration.
- **Gmsh** (>= version 4.10) -  mesh generation and pre-processing, it is optional and the kernel is implemented in the source code.
- **Eigen** (>= version 3.4.0) - a scientific matrix computation, it is optional and the headers are included in source code.

Optional Packages
---------------------
- **CUDA** package for GPU parallelization. 
- **PETSc** (>= version 3.13) - portable, extensible toolkit for scientific computation
- **doxygen** documentation system for automatic generating reference manual from the source code.

Implicit Static/Non-Linear Solvers
--------------------------------------

To use the implicit static or nonlinear solvers, at least one of the following libraries is required:

- **PETSc** - portable, extensible toolkit for scientific computation
- **LAPACK** - a standard software library for numerical linear algebra


Post-Processing
----------------

To use the post-processing outputs (optional steps):

- **ParaView** - Parallel visualization application
- **Tecplot** - Commerical software for field results




``OpenFDEM`` is flexible and can be run on Windows or Linux-like systems. The released version is for Windows x64.
